Java is not just Yogyakarta, but also the natural and cultural beauty spread throughout the island. As an experienced tour guide, I often arrange multi-destination tours that include:

## Mount Merapi: Safe Climbing with Spectacular Views

Mount Merapi is the highest active volcano in Java. Climbing tours to the summit or base camp provide a challenging hiking experience with extraordinary panoramas. Make sure to follow the safety briefing from local guides!

## Beautiful Beaches in Southern Java

From Parangtritis to Baron, the beaches in southern Yogyakarta offer volcanic black sand and waves suitable for surfing. Don't forget to try village tourism and fresh seafood cuisine.

## Prambanan Temple: Hindu Architectural Marvel

Unlike Borobudur, Prambanan is the largest Hindu temple complex in Southeast Asia. Evening tours with lights create a magical atmosphere, especially during the Ramayana Ballet performance.

## Java Tourism Tips

- Dry season (April-September) is the best time for mountain climbing
- Bring a jacket as the weather can change quickly
- Try local transportation like trains for an authentic experience
- Respect local customs and culture

Java offers endless adventures. Ready to explore?
